				Zalando Refresh
			</h1>
			<p>
				Zalando's landing page serves as the site's only gender-neutral
				entry point and is primarily designed to guide users toward a
				category choice. This redesign focuses on improving clarity and
				orientation for first-time visitors without changing the page's
				original purpose.

				<img
					src="images/zalando-old.png"

					loading="lazy"
					width="1280"
					height="832" />
			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Original landing page showing the previous carousel-based
				structure.
			</small>

			<h2>Carousel</h2>
			<p>
				The carousel hides useful information and limits readability. It
				is replaced with static content blocks with clear hierarchy.
			</p>

			<h2>Promotional Banner</h2>
			<p>
				The banner was made slightly bigger and bolder, and the wording
				was changed to speak directly to the user.
			</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>
			<p>
				Alignment issues between "Kläder" and "Kvinna" were corrected.
				The logo was enlarged, spacing adjusted, and the search field
				made cleaner.
			</p>

			<h2>Navigation</h2>
			<p>
				"Outlet" appeared active despite not being selected. This false
				state was removed, and Outlet is shown as page content instead
				of an active navigation item.
			</p>

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Final redesigned landing page with simplified layout and clearer
				content hierarchy.
			</small>

			<h2>Categories as content</h2>
			<p>
				Categories hidden on the landing page but available elsewhere on
				the site are added as page content. This provides more
				opportunity for exploration without increasing coginitive load.
