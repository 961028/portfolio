    <h1>Solace Care Redesign</h1>

    <p>
      Solace Care is a planning and coordination tool for people who have recently lost someone. This redesign reduces
      complexity, improves clarity, and supports emotionally sensitive users by reducing cognitive load and simplifying
      the interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Design goals</h2>

    <p>
      The project follows three core principles: low cognitive load, context-aware AI integration, and simple
      collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2>Opportunities for improvement</h2>

    <p>
      The current interface has a lot going on, which increases cognitive load.
      Although the platform aims to support AI assistance and collaborative planning, these features are not fully
      integrated into the main workflow.
    </p>

    <small class="image-description">New checklist view with expanded sections and a clearer hierarchy of tasks.</small>

    <h2>Design approach</h2>

    <p>
      The redesigned checklist keeps the original timeline structure but introduces a new section dedicated to the very
      first days after a loss.
      This helps new users focus on immediate priorities without being overwhelmed.

    </small>

    <p>
      A shared notes panel was added to each checklist item to support in-context collaboration. Co-planners can leave
      notes where they are most relevant instead of using external tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      The AI assistant is now a persistent chat panel available on all pages instead of in a separate view or behind a
      floating action button, enabling context-aware responses within the active workspace.

    <small class="image-description">AI-assisted workflow example, where the assistant responds directly to the active
      context.</small>

    <p>
      The interface has been reduced down to the essentials.
      Visual elements and content were simplified to reduce distraction and maintain a low cognitive load, which is
      especially important for the target group.

    <p>
      Finally, a documents page was added to provide a clear overview of important files in one place.
      Previously, users had to navigate to another area to access documents uploaded by other planners or by the
      deceased.
