				Apotek Hjärtat Mini
			</h1>
			<p>
				The pharmacy market is weakly differentiated and online is
				growing rapidly. Price pressure in e-commerce makes it difficult
				for Apotek Hjärtat. Despite a strong physical presence, they
				have difficulty growing profitably online. Apotek Hjärtat has a
				unique advantage through its national physical presence and
				strong consumer trust in self-care and advice.
			</p>

			<h2>Insight</h2>
			<p>
				In acute self-care situations, immediate access matters more
				than price. These needs often arise when waiting for delivery is
				not an option.
			</p>

			<h2>Strategy</h2>
			<p>
				Hjärtat will use its physical reach to solve urgent self-care
				needs instantly on site via app-based purchases. Being available
				when it matters creates a positive association, converts
				high-need moments into app adoption and repeat use, and builds
				mental availability through real world visibility and presence.
			</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>
				Hjärtat Mini is a network of unmanned pharmacy vending machines
				for self-care needs, placed where needs arise. All purchases are
				made digitally through Hjärtat's app, and the product is
				obtained immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
				This also allows the brand to represent everyday self-care in
				places like grocery stores, beaches, ski resorts, arenas, and
				nightlife environments.
			</p>

			<h2>How this could address the online challenge</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Captures demand when delivery is not an option</li>
				<li>Shifts choice from lowest price to fastest access</li>
				<li>
					Trains customers to resolve urgent needs using Hjärtat's app
				</li>
				<li>
					Builds association through exposure in everyday situations
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Hjärtat Mini builds digital habits through physical reach. It is
				a strategic response to the online challenge, not an alternative
				to e-commerce. The potential benefits are significant,
				especially since this is a mostly unexplored market in Sweden.
				It's also a fun idea, right?
